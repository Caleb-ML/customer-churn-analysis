Customer Churn Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn and predicting whether a customer will leave a service provider. The goal is to identify patterns and provide actionable insights to reduce churn.

Project Overview
Objective: To analyze customer data and predict churn using machine learning models.
Dataset: The dataset contains information about customers, their services, and whether they churned or not.
Key Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values in the TotalCharges column.
Performed one-hot encoding for categorical features.
Standardized numerical features like tenure and MonthlyCharges.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized churn distribution and feature relationships.
Explored correlations between features and churn.
Model Training:

Built and evaluated a Logistic Regression model.
Additional models like Decision Trees and Random Forests were explored for comparison.
Evaluation:

Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualized results using confusion matrices and classification reports.

Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 82%.
Key features influencing churn included:
Contract type.
Monthly charges.
Total charges.
Future Improvements
Implement advanced models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks for improved accuracy.
Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Incorporate more business-specific insights for actionable recommendations.
